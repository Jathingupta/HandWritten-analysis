The provided code employs the TensorFlow library to create and train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models tailored for recognizing handwritten images. It first readies the data through preprocessing, ensuring it's in the right format for model consumption. Subsequently, the code builds a CNN model that automatically learns relevant features from images, aiding in discerning distinct patterns. It also develops an RNN model capable of understanding sequential data, making it well-suited for scenarios like recognizing handwriting patterns.

The models' architecture is defined with specific layers, such as convolutional layers for the CNN and LSTM layers for the RNN. After architecture definition, the models are compiled, specifying the optimization method and loss function. They are then trained on the prepared dataset, where the models iteratively adjust their internal parameters to minimize the loss function. The models' accuracy is continually measured and displayed during training, offering insight into their progress.

The code finally evaluates both models on a test dataset, providing a quantitative measure of their performance. The achieved accuracy can serve as an indicator of how well the models generalize to new, unseen data. However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of the models depends on various factors, including the quality and size of the dataset, the chosen model architecture, and the hyperparameters used for training.
